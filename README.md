A collection of my thoughts and opinions on life that seemed clever or wise to myself at the moment I had them.

- Why do we love our child even minutes after they utterly disrespected you? Is it only because they are your offspring and you are hard-wired to love them? I don't think that is the only reason. A child may also display an act of great love minutes after the bad episode, and that is the major factor on us coming back to good terms quickly. Adult grudges last as long as they do in part because adults are more rational, and therefore are less likely to display love and caring if their last interaction with someone was a negative one. If only adults would display this "irrational kindness" people would spend much less time dwelling on bad feelings.
